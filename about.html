                    <h1 class="page-header frontH">Nell Nelson &amp; the "City Slave Girls"
                        Series</h1>
                    <p class="about">The series ran daily on the front page of The <i>Chicago
                            Times</i> in 1888. Helen Cusack-Carvalho posed as "Nell Nelson", a poor
                        female working girl and reported in-depth on the living conditions, wages,
                        and work environments of industrialized 19th-century Chicago. The early
                        publication of the series makes "Nelson" a pioneer of investigative
                        reporting with ground-breaking work exposing the mistreatment of women and
                        children.</p>
                    <p class="about">The success of her series is a bewilderment considering the
                        inversion of social norms represented in the writing of her expos√©. She
                        questioned the practices of the most prestigious men of Chicago through her
                        satirical and witty writing and beat the adversity of being a woman in the
                        19th-century since the publication of the series gained attention from
                        Chicago's political representatives and the owners of the companies
                        scrutinized.</p>
                    <p class="about">After the intial publication of the series, two books were
                        printed within the same year recognizing "Nelson" and her investigative
                        work. In addition to the two books, Nelson was hired by <i>The World</i> to
                        reproduce a similar series, in New York. Although the significance of the
                        series was recognized at the time of publication, Nelson's role in exposing
                        the hardships of the "City Slave Girls" lacks any proper representation in
                        modern history. The series should be a monumental resource for women's
                        history, labor history, and the history of undercover journalism.</p>
                    <p class="about">The biographical information on Helen Cusack-Carvalho is
                        illusive; currently, anything close to a complete biography of her is
                        nonexistent. The primary source of biographical information comes from a <a
                            href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17511341211188655"
                            target="_blank">journal article</a> by Eric W. Liguori published in
                        2012. In this article, Liguori writes that Helen's career as a journalist
                        allowed her to maintain her middle-class status she was born into. Liguori
                        reports that Helen married above her social class, to a man named Solomon
                        Solis Carvalho, in 1895. After marriage, Helen's journalism career ceased to
                        exist, and she lived the remainder of her life raising their two daughters.
                        According to an obituary in a 1945 <i>New York Times</i>, Helen died in New
                        Jersey. The obituary lacks any special recognition of her investigative
                        series, despite its influential effects on the labor reforms of the late
                        19th-century.</p>
